# SEC02-AZ100 — Create an Azure Policy

## Introduction

I've chosen this topic, as it was one of those from the **100 cloud ideas** with a difficulty level **100**. 
It's a security related subject. Azure Policy allows to impose specific rules on the resources in order to enforce unified,
standardized compliance of the resources usage across an organisation. 

## Prerequisite

Need to know the following:
* What is Azure Policy ?
* What does the term scope refer to?
* How many policy definitions can you have per scope?
* What is an initiative definition?

## Cloud Research

When I started learning about the Azure Policy, there were some terms or concepts I wasn't fully familiar with.
Therefore, I had to do some extra research to better understand what I read. It concerned especially two concepts,
namely: **compliance** and **remediation**.
