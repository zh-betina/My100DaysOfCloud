# SEC02-AZ100 — Create an Azure Policy

## Introduction

I've chosen this topic, as it was one of those from the **100 cloud ideas** with a difficulty level **100**. 
It's a security related subject. Azure Policy allows to impose specific rules on the resources in order to enforce unified,
standardized compliance of the resources usage across an organisation. 

## Prerequisite

Need to know the following:
* What is Azure Policy ? <br>
<i>It's a defined rule, which allows to determine if certains specific actions defined in that rule, are allowed on given ressources.
What is important to know, is that Azure policy doesn't check if a user performing a given action is allowed to do so, as it doesn't
manage user permissions, but rather than that, it verifies the resources properties.</i> <br>
  
* What does the term scope refer to?
* How many policy definitions can you have per scope?
* What is an initiative definition? <br>
  <i>It's a group of policy definitions. It allows to group multiple policies into a single bundle and assign it to a scope.</i> <br>

Keywords : compliance, remediation, policy effect, policy definition, built-in policies, 

## Cloud Research

When I started learning about the Azure Policy, there were some terms or concepts I wasn't fully familiar with.
Therefore, I had to do some extra research to better understand what I read. It concerned especially two concepts,
namely: **compliance** and **remediation**.

To get familiar with the subject itself, I went through these materials :
